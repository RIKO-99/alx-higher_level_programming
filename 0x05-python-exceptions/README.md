This is a synopsis of the project done in python 3.8 programing language in an ubuntu 20.4 environment. This project is an implementation of exceptions in Python using try. except, and finally statement with the help of structred case scenarios in the Alx world :). 
Apart from the syntax errors in python, Errors are the problems in a program due to which the program will stop the execution. On the other hand, exceptions are raised when some internal events occur which changes the normal flow of the program.
