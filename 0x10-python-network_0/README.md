HTTP is an asymmetric request-response client-server protocol as illustrated.  An HTTP client sends a request message to an HTTP server.  The server, in turn, returns a response message.  In other words, HTTP is a pull protocol, the client pulls information from the server (instead of server pushes information down to the client).
