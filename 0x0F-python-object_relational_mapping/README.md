This project is based on the object relational mappers (ORM) which ia a code library that automates the transfer of data stored in relational database tables into objects that are mostly used in application code.

In this project i used ORM with python code instead of SQL to create, read update and delete data schemas in databases.

In the first part, i used the module MySQLdb to connect to a MySQL database and execute your SQL queries.
In the second part, you will use the module SQLAlchemy an ORM. The purpose of anORM is to abstract the storage to the usage.

My files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5) executed with MySQLdb version 2.0.x also executed with SQLAlchemy version 1.4.x
